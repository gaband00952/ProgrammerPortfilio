            <h3>Pharmacy Tech System </h4>
                
                 <p>
                    This was a system I worked on in my second year in the Information Technology Programmer Analyst program. I was on this project for about 7 weeks.
                    This system was also made using react,javascript and c#.
                 </p><p>
                    I worked on it in a team with two other developers and a group of business analysts overseeing our progress.
                    We inherited the code from the team working on it the previous year, so we were not starting from scratch.
                   <p>
                    The system was for the pharmacy technician program at NBCC, and it was Â to offer students a safe and interactive environment to practice entering prescription orders,
                    verifying medication details, and printing dispensing labels, ultimately bridging the gap between theory and real-world practice
                </p>
                    My portion of it was finding bugs and fixing the tasks that the team from the previous year had missed, not completed or did not
                    have working when they finished the project. I also did many documents for the team, like the website wireframe document.

            <h3>Quality Assurance Testing Team</h4><p>
                This was a system I worked on in my second year in the Information Technology Programmer Analyst program.
                I was on this project for about 7 or 8 weeks.
                The group had three people, but one of the members was testing another project while another team member and I tested another project.
                The Website that the development team was to completly finished but our testing was.
               </p> <p>
                We worked on a program for Moncton Community Residencies. The system that is being developed
                should be an application that enables online form submissions and
                automates the generation of reports from the collected data. MCRI expects to significantly reduce
                the time spent on manual data entry and report generation, eliminate human errors and enhance
                the overall efficiency of data processing
               
                <p>
                    My portion of the project was to make automated tests using selenium in c# to test what the development group had already
                    made. The requirements document given to us contained 20 user stories, and the tasks were split between the other team members working on the same project.
